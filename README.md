# nonrelational-databases

## This repository contains an application with parcel-locker logic. It stores its data on different databases.

The purpose of this project was to learn about different storage mechanisms, ORM and also event streaming with Kafka.

As an introduction, the first branch prepared was an application with a relational database system (PostgreSQL) and Hibernate as persistence provider.

The names of the branches correspond to the databases used.
